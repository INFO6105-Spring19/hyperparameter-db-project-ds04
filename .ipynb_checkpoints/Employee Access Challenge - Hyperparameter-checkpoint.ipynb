    "Since determining hyperparameters that optimize model performance can be a tedious and difficult task. Thus, This research project focuses on developing a hyperparameter database that allows users to visualize and understand how to choose hyperparameters that maximize the predictive power of their models. The database is created by running millions of hyperparameter values, over thousands of public datasets and calculating the individual conditional expectation of every hyperparameter to the quality of a model. As a Data Science fellow we will be finding the Hyperparameters. \n",

    "By this research project in the end we will be able to achieve hyperparameters. \n",

    "### What are Hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter are the parameters which are defined before running any machine learning algorithms. That means Hyperparameters are model-specific properties that are 'fixed' before you even train and test your model on data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically Hyperparameters are specified for tuning purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Hyperparameter is important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are important because they directly control the behaviour of the training algorithm and have a significant impact on the performance of the model that is being trained."

The conceptual paradigm MapReduce (AKA “divide and conquer and combine”), along with a good concurrent application structure, (c.f. jsr166y and NonBlockingHashMap) enable this type of scaling in H2O.\n",
